--In the first problem one encounters the adapted implementation of matrix and sparse matrix. Adding, deleting, listing and many different functions appear.

--In the second problem, there are array based and linked list adaptations of stack and queue algorithms. The application content includes functions such as pop, push, top, isempty and count. There is also a unit test that tests these functions.

--In the third problem, there is the application that includes the infix and postfix expression operations. Also, we encounter the evaluate infix, validate infix and infix to postfix functions.
